# **Cybersecurity Incident Response Workflow**

## **Repository Name:** `Incident-Response-Workflow`

### **Overview**  
This repository provides a **structured incident response plan** based on the **seven components of incident response** outlined in the image. It includes best practices, response scripts, documentation templates, and case studies to guide **IT security teams and system administrators** in managing and mitigating security incidents effectively.

### **Ransomware Attack on a Corporate Network**
#### **Problem Statement**
A **corporate network** is hit by a **ransomware attack**, encrypting critical business data and demanding payment for decryption. Employees report system slowdowns, file access issues, and suspicious pop-ups demanding Bitcoin payments.

---

### **Incident Response Breakdown Using the Seven Components**
#### **1️⃣ Pre-Incident Preparation**
✔ Establish a **Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)**.  
✔ Maintain **up-to-date system backups** and an **incident response plan**.  
✔ Train employees on **phishing detection** and cybersecurity hygiene.  
✔ Implement **endpoint detection tools (EDR) and intrusion detection systems (IDS)**.  

#### **2️⃣ Detection of Incidents**
✔ **IT team identifies unusual network activity**, including:  
   - Sudden spikes in CPU usage.  
   - Unauthorized encryption of sensitive files.  
   - Ransomware messages on user screens.  
✔ Security logs reveal a **compromised user account executing malicious scripts**.  

#### **3️⃣ Initial Response**
✔ **Isolate affected systems** to prevent ransomware spread.  
✔ **Disable network access** for compromised machines.  
✔ Notify key stakeholders (**IT security team, management, legal team**).  
✔ Identify the ransomware variant using **malware analysis tools**.  

#### **4️⃣ Formulate Response Strategy**
✔ Decide on the **containment and eradication approach**:  
   - Restore from **secure backups** (if available).  
   - Use **decryption tools** (if available for the ransomware variant).  
   - Strengthen firewall & EDR policies to **block further infection**.  
✔ **Determine legal & regulatory compliance requirements** before action.  

#### **5️⃣ Investigate the Incident**
✔ **Data Collection:**  
   - Gather **forensic evidence** from affected systems.  
   - Collect logs from **SIEM tools, firewalls, and antivirus software**.  
✔ **Data Analysis:**  
   - Identify **entry point (phishing email, RDP vulnerability, etc.)**.  
   - Analyze malware behavior using **sandbox environments**.  
   - Determine **affected data and users**.  

#### **6️⃣ Reporting**
✔ **Prepare an incident report** detailing:  
   - Attack timeline.  
   - Affected systems and users.  
   - Security weaknesses exploited.  
   - Actions taken and recommendations.  
✔ **Submit the report** to IT leadership and regulatory authorities if required.  

#### **7️⃣ Resolution, Recovery & Security Measures**
✔ **Eradicate** ransomware files & ensure **no persistence mechanisms** remain.  
✔ **Recover encrypted files** from backups.  
✔ **Reinforce security controls**:  
   - Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.  
   - Patch vulnerabilities (e.g., **RDP lockdown, software updates**).  
   - Enhance **employee cybersecurity awareness training**.  
✔ Conduct a **post-incident review** to improve future response strategies.
